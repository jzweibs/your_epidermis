There is a huge zit on my neck and I'm making it worse. 
I should be working--I have a lot to do!--but I am alternately stress-snacking and picking at this zit, which is painful. The picking offers fleeting relief, a quick hit, but is manifestly unhelpful. 
This, momentary pleasure or at least pain relief, is often why we do unhelpful things, why we continue to take actions that are against our own interests; and this is basically the definition of addiction or compulsion. 

So often I have lost myself in this behavior.
