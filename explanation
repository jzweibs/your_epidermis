What it is:
This project is intended as a daily writing practice and a series of steps toward a larger project, which I envision as a series of essays around the subject of skin. I am using github because I have long been curious about its version control function. I am not a coder; I know I am using the platform in what is probably an inappropriate and dilettantish manner, but I'm doing it anyway. 
This project is also intended as an unmasking--a way for me to confront my perfectionism and lay bare the messy, nonlinear process of writing. I'm putting it all out here, errors and purple prose, all wrong and ugly and cobbled together, rosy and smooth and warts and all.
