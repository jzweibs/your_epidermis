I stabbed myself in the...web? the other day. That bit of flesh between my left thumb and forefinger, stupidly using a too-sharp knife to remove the ring of plastic from a new jar of almond butter. 
What is a wound? Can we start there? 
Something breaks the skin.
The skin is our "largest organ" but to me it does not feel like an organ. What does it feel like? A suit? A tissue wrapping, semi-living, semi-lycra. The skin of my big toes feels more mineral than animal. The skin of my lips, around my eyes, feels closer, more like a stomach or a heart. 
The skin opens up and is clouded by blood, its intricacies invisible to the unaided ("naked") eye. But so much happens in a wound.

-clotting cascade
-leukocytes / immune response
-rubor, dolor, calor, tumor
-skin knits itself back together, is alive, seems dead

Recently in something I read the edges of a wound were described as its "lips," which really grossed me out. But I was reminded of it when looking at my web-stab, a little red mouth. When I was seventeen or eighteen I was with my cousin, buying drugs. The dealers were a boy and girlfriend and had just gotten their tongues pierced. I felt like everyone I knew got their tongue pierced around this time, and I still can't fathom why. The boy and girl were talking about how much Listerine they had to use because, "the mouth is like an open wound, you know." Stoned, I forgot momentarily about their actual open mouth-wounds and thought, "how poetic, how deep, the mouth is like an open wound."

But think, mucosal surfaces like the mouth and eyes and genitals and nose are almost permanent wounds, transition areas between the air, skin, and ... innards. So I guess this--the edge--is as good as any place to start thinking about skin.
