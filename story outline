The window is open, and M can feel the breeze on her cheeks. High above the green campus, August air rattling with cicadas, she's perched, waiting. Everything is ready: her schedule, her notebooks, her inkpens, and a new kind of giddiness. How ready, how relieved she is to be away from home--if only she could have gone farther.
She tenses at the sound of the doorknob, her roommate slides in all rosy. "Hi M!" she chirps, and M puts on a smile. Roomie has a bag from the shool bookstore, something logoed, something tie-dyed, something plastic. "Are you going to the Engineering Mixer tonight?"
M knows she should go, meet the other brainy women she'll be living amongst, try to charm and be charmed, but she doesn't want to. At the moment, she feels no curiosity for them, no need for new friends. The newness has been coming thick and fast. She could use a few hours of solitude, rather to daydream than to pretend.
"Ah, I'm not sure, maybe for a little while. My back is killing me, though."
This isn't untrue. M's been dealing with this shooting pain for years, fingers of fire extending from her lower back and into her hips, especially her right one. She keeps the embers just glowing by sitting carefully and submitting to awkward and specious chiropractic adjustments. 

She might consider going if she thought there would be anyone interesting to meet. But her imagination is filled with odd girls, shy ones and overenthused ones, jutting elbows, a crust of pimples--her father and brothers in grotesque female miniature, talking in graphs. She waits for her roommate to leave, then puts on her robe and sandals and takes herself quietly down the hall to the showers. It will be years before she has a place of her own, clean tiles beneath her feet.

The hot needles of water on her back, the white noise, the feeling, however fleeting, of anonymity and aloneness--this is all intoxicating. She imagines what it would be like to have someone else in here with her, rivulets on another body, more steam, more heat, someone to explore with.

But she is alone. High above a quiet midwest city, newly free and also trapped, waiting for her life to change. 



On Wednesday, she is going to see the orthopedic surgeon for a consultation. Her mom is coming, which is both comforting and stifling. They'll get sandwiches after, at a teahouse near the University. 





Some kind of structure

*Opening Image* (visual that represents the struggle and tone)
Something slips and falls

*Setup* (expand on snapshot--character's world, what's missing, what's the theme of the story?)
A kid named M goes off to college, knowing she is smart, longing to go far away, a certain fire in her loins

Her classes are filled with people named Dale, hayseeds sprouting all over the town that once seemed cosmopolitan 

She keeps the dorm-people at a distance, deliberately mispronouncing her own name when she introduces herself to them

She feels tense, longing, uncomfortable in spirit and in body

*Catalyst* (moment of change)
Her back is killing her--she has a slipped disc
After years of transient relief from chiropractic quackery, she goes (with her mother) to an orthopedic surgeon

Orthopedic--right, children?
She looks at him and...something happens
He sees her, that unmistakable electricity passes between them

*Debate*
There's no way an eighteen-year-old and her 40-year-old back surgeon will fall in love

*Journey Begins / Act 2*
but somehow, that's what happens?

*B Story* (nugget of truth / related to the theme) 
?

*Promise of the Premise* (main character explores new world and audience is entertained)
fabulous sex, chocolate pudding for breakfast

*Midpoint* (everything is great or everything is awful)
travel to canada?

*Danger* (doubt, jealousy, fear, real and imagined bad guys => situation changes)
confrontation with ex
M sees herself for as young and vulnerable as she really is
and sees doc as flawed, human, small, soft

*All is Lost* (everything has changed, something must die)

*Dark Night of Soul* (hopelessness and mourning)

*Try Again / Act 3* (new idea / inspiration / advice, perhaps related to theme spurs main character on)

*Finale* (main character incorporates theme, synthesis of A story and B story)

*Final Image* (opposite of opening image, evidence of change)
