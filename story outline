Some kind of structure

*Opening Image* (visual that represents the struggle and tone)
Something slips and falls

*Setup* (expand on snapshot--character's world, what's missing, what's the theme of the story?)
A kid named M goes off to college, knowing she is smart, longing to go far away, a certain fire in her loins

Her classes are filled with people named Dale, hayseeds sprouting all over the town that once seemed cosmopolitan 

She keeps the dorm-people at a distance, deliberately mispronouncing her own name when she introduces herself to them

She feels tense, longing, uncomfortable in spirit and in body

*Catalyst* (moment of change)
Her back is killing her--she has a slipped disc
After years of transient relief from chiropractic quackery, she goes (with her mother) to an orthopedic surgeon

Orthopedic--right, children?
She looks at him and...something happens
He sees her, that unmistakable electricity passes between them

*Debate*
There's no way an eighteen-year-old and her 40-year-old back surgeon will fall in love

*Journey Begins / Act 2*
but somehow, that's what happens?

*B Story* (nugget of truth / related to the theme) 
?

*Promise of the Premise* (main character explores new world and audience is entertained)
fabulous sex, chocolate pudding for breakfast

*Midpoint* (everything is great or everything is awful)
travel to canada?

*Danger* (doubt, jealousy, fear, real and imagined bad guys => situation changes)
confrontation with ex
M sees herself for as young and vulnerable as she really is
and sees doc as flawed, human, small, soft

*All is Lost* (everything has changed, something must die)

*Dark Night of Soul* (hopelessness and mourning)

*Try Again / Act 3* (new idea / inspiration / advice, perhaps related to theme spurs main character on)

*Finale* (main character incorporates theme, synthesis of A story and B story)

*Final Image* (opposite of opening image, evidence of change)
