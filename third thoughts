There is a huge zit on my neck and I'm making it worse. 
I should be working--I have a lot to do!--but I am alternately stress-snacking and picking at this zit, which is painful. The picking offers fleeting relief, a quick hit, but is manifestly unhelpful. 
This, momentary pleasure or at least pain relief, is often why we do unhelpful things, why we continue to take actions that are against our own interests; and this is basically the definition of addiction or compulsion. 

So often I have lost myself in this behavior.

It feels like the beginning of a small goiter, this neck-zit. I just want to make it disappear. This perverse urge to pick at a ... blemish / pustule / papule / lump / what's the right word?...is really so counterproductive. 

It's really hard to talk or write about, too! It's embarrassing and gross. I do not want to be a person who picks at her skin. For years, in fact, out of unconscious emotional self-protection, I blamed this behavior on an inherent quality of my skin. My skin is "oily" (true) and "acne prone" (maybe true). But deep down I think I knew it was mainly a problem because I made it a problem.

Looking into this a few years ago I discovered a few things. 
1) I am not the only one who does this (duh, nobody is the only one who does anything)
2) "This" is referred to in many ways, as "skin picking" or acne excoriee des jeunes filles

Does my skin "know" that I am writing about it? Another huge cystic pimple emerged on the left side of my chin this week (sinister, painful, irresistable to me, an obsessively grooming primate). 

My body is changing all the time, hormones, secretions, respirations, metabolisms. Is this happening because my period will return soon, after nearly two years' absence? Or because I baked and ate many a cookie this week? Lack of sleep? Drooling in sleep? Sweat?

what does the skin know? what do we know with our skin? what of the prickles on the back of the neck?
