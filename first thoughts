I've been sitting on some ideas for awhile, and now is the time for them to hatch. I'm starting with a random list of broad topics and little ideas for this project, a pre-outline, out of order. 

*What is skin?
**how does it develop? how is it organized? what's unique about mammal skin, human skin?
*Skin as "the largest organ" / skin as organ at all / how I thoughtlessly hurt my skin in ways that would be unthinkable to do to an internal organ
*Skin holds everything in, keeps most things out
**Permeability of skin
*Skin as "the edge where we meet the world" per Rachel Budde on the "So You Wanna Be a Witch" podcast

*Hair
**leg hair / hair removal / the vagina monologues
**chin hair, my bearded grandma, tweezers pilfered from college roommate that I continue to use >10 years later
**bleaching hair (my head, my mother's face)

*Acne
**complex and poorly understood pathophysiology (interview a derm?)
**skin picking / dermatillomania / "acne excoriee des jeunes filles"
**trichotillomania, affectations, $10 words, Mr. Engel in 9th-grade world cultures class
*Seeing my baby's skin and feeling gentler toward my own

*Makeup
**What it was like to wear too much as an early teen, how desparate and sad and careful it made me
**But also how beautiful I felt, how I dreamed of clear smooth skin
***Acne equated with poor hygiene, laziness, immorality 
****Skin and outward appearance as representations of interior life, self-discipline, etc.
**Going to the Clinique counter in the department store when I was a kid / the lip balm in my friend's medicine cabinet

*Never-ending product quest / the belief that a drug / wash / toner / tincture whatever will offer a cure
**The history and science behind some topical skin remedies
**The appeal of prescription medicine and on the flip side, the lure of "herbal" / "natural" remedies 

*Pigment / tanning / naive ideas about skin color from a person who grew up in a mostly white place
*Tattoos / how they work / why I want one / why I don't have one 

Wrinkles
*how do they happen / why do we care? 
Itches
*same / do I have psoriasis or something? / the perils of self-diagnosis
